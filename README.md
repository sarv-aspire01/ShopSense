 The ShopSense is an AI-driven platform that empowers consumers by providing clear, verifiable details about food and personal care products.
It offers insights on nutritional content, ingredient safety, and environmental sustainability, helping users make informed decisions.


Currently, ShopSense operates as a prototype within a jupitor notebook environment,
allowing for an agile and flexible development process.
ShopSense will evolve into a full-scale platform with user-friendly features like barcode scanning and product
image recognition, promoting healthier, more sustainable consumer behavior. 

**method and Data Source**: Uses Publicly available APIs (google Gemini) for product and nutritional data retrieval, data is Sourcesd from offivial Websites, research Papers and Gov  Health Websites(FSSAI, FDA, FDC NCBI..etc)



here is the prototype of the output the plateform currently produces upon users input. currently I’ve used one of the most popular biscuit brand BRITANIA GOOD DAY
BISCUIT  as a product for testing.
