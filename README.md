**Sustainable Ai Plateform "ShopSense" For Enhancing Transparency and Trust in Consumer Goods**
 The ShopSense is an AI-driven platform that empowers consumers by providing clear, verifiable details about food and personal care products.
It offers insights on nutritional content, ingredient safety, and environmental sustainability, helping users make informed decisions. 
Currently operating as a Python demo, ShopSense will evolve
into a full-scale platform with user-friendly features like barcode scanning and product
image recognition, promoting healthier, more sustainable consumer behavior.


here is the prototype of the output the plateform currently produces upon users input. currently Iâ€™ve used one of the most popular biscuit brand BRITANIA GOOD DAY
BISCUIT  as a product for testing.
